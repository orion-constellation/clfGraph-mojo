## Overview

### Research Goal

Incorporate a Classification Gate into a Hiearchal Mixture of Experts

### Hiearachal Mixture of Experts (HMoE) Model

Research and Development of Composite Architecture enhanced by custom SIMD
and Operations for expanding knowledge of structuring MITRE Attack as Graphs
as well as subsampling using GNNs.

This is purely a fun exploration and learning activity both in the space of GNN's

**It can also serve as a WandB logging sklearn template on it's own by extracting the sklearn_baseline**


ClfGraph is a research project focused on developing a model architecture that leverages MITRE data to create a shared representation layer, coupled with a classifier to gate a Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HMoE) GCN and GAT models. The aim is to periodically build fingerprints of the information using graphs. The project integrates various components and uses Weights and Biases for experiment tracking.
